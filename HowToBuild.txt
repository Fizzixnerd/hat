How to build the Hat Package

Most of the building work is done by the cabal, using the hat.cabal file.

However, the trusted libraries that traced programs use are not generated
automatically by cabal, but have to be constructed manually.
There does not seem to be any easy way to let cabal do this work.

The library modules have to be transformed like other traced programs.
The modules are all in the library folder and its subfolders (hierarchical libray).

Each file is transformed by e.g.
../trans/HatTrans --trusted --hierarchical -I. Random.hs
The files starting with Prelude, which form the Prelude, need the --prelude 
option to prevent cyclic importing of the Prelude itself.

The generated *.hx files stay in the library folder. 

The generated libraries/Hat/..*.hs files have to be copied to the
Hat folder. That folder contains already a few handwritten files
that will be linked with the transformed files.

The *.hx files and the transformed *.hs files are in the git repository,
so rebuilding is only necessary if any of the original library files
is changed or the transformation changes.
