Handle whole Haskell syntax plus some extensions:
  haskell-src-exts

Use arbitrary (trusted) libraries:
  build hat-cabal which transforms a cabal package into a cabal hat-package that
  wraps the original package (depending on it).
  build also(?) hat-wrap which given a set of Haskell modules produces a set of
  hat-modules that wrap the given ones.
  Wrapping requires type declarations for all exported functions.
  Wrapping will transform all class and instance definitions

Tool text user interfaces:
  editable command line: haskeline
  colour and cursor-movements: ansi-terminal System.Console.ANSI

Problem with defaulting:
  XExtendedDefaultRules is insufficient, only for ghci to handle also Show, Eq and Ord
